# Script-Hub

This repo contains a collection of scripts and useful information I've created or gathered. Files are organized based on the use-case of them, but some may technically dip into other categories - as such, I've documented each one below and will try to keep the links to them up-to-date.

Please be aware that not all of these scripts have been tested outside my working environment, but I have made efforts to try and make them as easy to run as possible. Apologies if you find that isn't the case.
